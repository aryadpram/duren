# duren (*work in progress*)
The goal of this project is to build a cost-effective system to detect unwanted human presence (e.g., thieves) on a farm. Due to budget constraints, microwave sensors even though they are far superior. Additionally, the system is designed to operate in areas without access to electricity, making low-power consumption a priority.

## Features
- Detects human movement using PIR sensors.
- Operates in off-grid environments.
- Designed for easy maintenance with minimal intervention.
- and more as i continue to complete and refine this project
